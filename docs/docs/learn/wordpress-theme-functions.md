title: WordPress Theme Functions
---

The current WordPress install is using a theme to power headless-oriented functionality:

- ACF Local JSON sync
- Algolia customizations
- Preview URLs
- Registering Custom Post Types and Menus
- Thumbnail and image sizes
- WP GraphQL helper functions
- and more...

Check out our [headless theme](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-headless-wordpress/tree/main/themes/wds_headless) on Github.

_Note: This theme will be changing into its own stand-alone product (or plugin) in the near future._
