## Introduction

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where most tutorials about _"how to build a headless WordPress website"_ stop. You'd be hard pressed to find a deep-dive into supporting advanced features, because **headless WordPress is hard**.

At WebDevStudios we believe that **WordPress is so much more than a blog**-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this framework, **we've figured out the "hard stuff"** and placed the sum of our knowledge into something both the community and our future projects could use as a jumping off point.
