## Why?

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many _"how to build a headless WordPress website"_ tutorials stop. You'd be hard pressed to find anything about supporting advanced features and plugins because **_headless WordPress is hard._**

At WebDevStudios we believe that WordPress is so much more than a blog-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this starter, we've figured out the "hard stuff" and placed the sum of our knowledge into something both the community and our future projects could use as a jumping off point.

## How's this all work?

The frontend (Next.js) talks to the backend (WordPress) via GraphQL.
